2. Reflection: Through this article, I know the nuances among programmers, software engineers, and software developers and some working pipeline within the roles. First, software engineers are in charge of using modeling language and other tools to devise solutions that can often be applied to real-world problems. Somewhat similar to the engineers, software developers also work across functional teams to transform requirements into features, managing development processes, and also write some codes. Then, programmers interpret the software developers’ and engineers’ instructions and take the responsibility of coding in different languages to realize specific tasks. It is also important to learn a more specific life cycle of software development: Selecting a methodology (which includes Agile development), Gathering requirements, Choosing or building an architecture, Developing a design, Constructing code, Testing, Managing configuration and defects, Deploying, Migrating data, Managing and measuring the project.
